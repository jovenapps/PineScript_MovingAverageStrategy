##MOVING AVERAGE STRATEGY##
by: Carl Joven (jovenapps)


The ma_strategy.tps is a pine script for Trading View. 

Moving Averages (ma):
 - fast: 9ema
 - mid: 20ma
 - trend basis: 50ma


Thesis:
- Enter when price crosses the fastest ma, but in line with the mid ma
- Target: Forex, Crypto


Status:
- Ongoing development.
- Script in indicator phase (not yet complete for strategy phase)


To Improve:
- Entry alerts (both long and short) after ranged price movement
- Special alert for tight price candles followed by ma alignment
- Special alert for price in trend, pullback to fast ma, and return back into trend (existing)
- Range definition identification: width/number of candles and height/range or prices
- Cutting (this is for the scripted strategy)
